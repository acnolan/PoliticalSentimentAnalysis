# Political Sentiment Analysis in MATLAB
This repo contains some basic MATLAB scripts and datasets for visualizing sentiment and emotional analysis of text. So far I am using it specifically for presidential speeches. But could be used on any text.

All MATLAB scripts happened to be written right around the 24b release, so they have been tested in 24a and 24b. Requires Text Analytics toolbox to run.
